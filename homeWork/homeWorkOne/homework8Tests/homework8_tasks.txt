Task1.
Create unit tests for Department class in Hometask Project (See attached solution NUnitLectureExapmles)
Use proper Naming for project, class and methods.

Task2.
Practice writing Assert expressions. Think of 15 examples of Assert expressions. Use different Assert methods and constraints.
Write each example in both classic Assert model and Constraint-based model.

Example:

1.Check collection is not empty:
public void AssertCollection_NotEmpty()
{
int[] collection1 = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };
Assert.That(collection1, Is.Not.Empty);
CollectionAssert.IsNotEmpty(collection1);
}
